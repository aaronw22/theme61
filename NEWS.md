# theme61 0.2.0

* *Jack please add your changes here.*
* Many functions have been renamed to more closely align with existing ggplot2 function names, with `_e61` appended to them, for example `e61_colour_manual` now becomes `scale_colour_e61`.

# theme61 0.1.0

This is the first functional release of theme61 containing everything you need to make a graph in the e61 style.

* This includes `ggplot` functions that customise the theme, axes and other graph elements.
* Implements the e61 Institute colour palette in `scale_colour/fill_*` function and provides the colour names as data files for manual access as required.
* Save functions to ensure that default graphs have the appropriate sizing and dimensions.
