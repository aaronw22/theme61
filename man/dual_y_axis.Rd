\title{Dual y-axis graphing functions}
\usage{
sec_rescale_inv(values, scale = 1, shift = 0)

sec_rescale(
  values,
  scale = t61_env$sec_axis_scale,
  shift = t61_env$sec_axis_shift
)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Vector of data that would normally be passed as the y aesthetic
in the graph.}

\item{scale}{Numeric. Multiplicative factor that rescales the axis. For
example, if the scale was originally 0 to 50, then \code{scale = 0.1} would
rescale this to 0 to 5.}

\item{shift}{Numeric. Moves the axis up and down. For example, if the scale
was 0 to 5, \code{shift = 5} moves the secondary scale down by 5 units to
range from -5 to 0.}
}
\description{
\code{ggplot2}, by design, makes it rather difficult to create graphs where
the primary and secondary y-axis are on different scales. Hadley Wickham
claims this is to prevent people from abusing secondary y-axis to show dodgy
correlations (investment banking-style). However, sometimes they have valid
uses and the following functions enable this with as little fiddliness as
possible.
}
\details{
\code{sec_rescale_inv} is used in the geom that will be displayed on the
secondary axis. \code{sec_rescale} is used in the \code{sec_axis} argument of
\code{scale_y_continuous_e61}.

See the examples for how to use the two functions to manipulate the secondary
axis. Trial and error will be needed to select appropriate scale and shift
values.

**Note:** Due to the way that ggplot functions interact with the R
environment, you have to run the code that generates the graph **twice**
after you change it before the changes will show up.

  # Set rescaled_sec = TRUE in scale_y_continuous_e61() to format the breaks correctly.
