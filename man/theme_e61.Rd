\usage{
theme_e61(
  y_top = TRUE,
  adj = -12,
  fix_left = 0,
  legend = c("none", "bottom", "top", "left", "right"),
  legend_title = FALSE,
  panel_borders = TRUE,
  background = "white",
  base_size = 10,
  base_family = "Arial",
  base_line_size = points_to_mm(0.75),
  base_rect_size = points_to_mm(1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_top}{Defaults to TRUE. Moves the y-axis title to the top.}

\item{adj}{Either a single numeric to adjust left and right axis titles
simultaneously or a vector of 2 numerics to adjust each axis title
separately. More negative values move the text closer to the graph panel.
Defaults to -12 which seems to work well for y-axis with 1-3 character-wide
values.}

\item{fix_left}{Optional. Sometimes if the value of the \code{adj} argument
is too negative, the margins on the left side of the graph start to cut off
some of the text. Provide a small positive value (5?) to correct this.}

\item{legend}{Character. Legend position, use "none" (default) to hide the
legend.}

\item{legend_title}{Logical. Include Legend Title? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{panel_borders}{Logical. Show panel borders? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{background}{Character. Options are "white" (default) or "grey".}

\item{base_size}{Numeric. Chart font size. Default is 10.}

\item{base_family}{Character. Chart font family. Default is Arial.}

\item{base_line_size}{Numeric. Default line width.}

\item{base_rect_size}{Numeric. Default rect width.}
