\usage{
theme_e61(
  y_top = TRUE,
  adj = -12,
  fix_left = 0,
  legend = c("none", "bottom", "top", "left", "right"),
  legend_title = FALSE,
  aspect_ratio = 0.75,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_top}{Defaults to TRUE. Puts the y-axis title at the top. If you
change this argument you also need to change the argument with the same
name in \code{\link[theme61]{scale_y_continuous_e61}}.}

\item{adj}{Either a single numeric to adjust left and right axis titles
simultaneously or a vector of 2 numerics to adjust each axis title
separately. More negative values move the text closer to the graph panel.
Defaults to -12 which seems to work well for y-axis with 1-3 character-wide
values.}

\item{fix_left}{Optional. Sometimes if the value of the \code{adj} argument
is too negative, the margins on the left side of the graph start to cut off
some of the text. Provide a small positive value (5?) to correct this.}

\item{legend}{Character. Legend position, use "none" (default) to hide the
legend.}

\item{legend_title}{Logical. Include Legend title? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{aspect_ratio}{Numeric. Sets the aspect ratio of the graph panel.}

\item{panel_borders}{Logical. Show panel borders? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{background}{Character. Options are "white" (default) or "grey".}

\item{base_size}{Numeric. Chart font size. Default is 10.}

\item{base_family}{Character. Chart font family. Default is Arial.}

\item{base_line_size}{Numeric. Default line width.}

\item{base_rect_size}{Numeric. Default rect width.}

\description{
Applies the e61 theme to ggplot graphs and provides arguments to adjust graph
appearance. If you are looking to change the appearance of titles or labels,
check the arguments in \code{\link[theme61]{labs_e61}}, which are probably
what you are looking for.
}
\details{
\code{scale_y_continuous_e61()} should be used in conjunction with this
function to ensure that theming and axes are applied correctly.
