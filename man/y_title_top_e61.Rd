\alias{y_title_top_e61}
\title{Reposition y-axis titles to the top}
\usage{
y_title_top_e61(adj = -18, fix_left = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{Either a single numeric to adjust left and right axis titles
simultaneously or a vector of 2 numerics to adjust each axis title
separately. More negative values move the text closer to the graph panel.
Defaults to -18 which seems to work well for y-axis with 1-3 character-wide
values.}

\item{fix_left}{Optional. Sometimes if the value of the \code{adj} argument
is too negative, the margins on the left side of the graph start to cut off
some of the text. Provide a small positive value (5?) to correct this.}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
Moves the y-axis titles from the side (ggplot default) to the top of the
y-axis and rotates the text to be horizontal.
}
