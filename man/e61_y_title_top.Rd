\name{e61_y_title_top}
\alias{e61_y_title_top}
\title{Reposition y-axis titles to the top}
\usage{
e61_y_title_top(adj = -18, fix_left = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{Either a single numeric to adjust left and right axis titles
simultaneously or a vector of 2 numerics to adjust each axis title
separately. More negative values move the text closer to the graph panel.
Defaults to -18 which seems to work well for y-axis with 3 character-wide
values.}

\item{fix_left}{Optional. Sometimes if the value of the `adj` argument is too
negative, the margins on the left side of the graph start to cut off some
of the text. Add a small positive value of `fix_left` to correct this.}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
Moves the y-axis titles from the side (ggplot default) to the top of the
y-axis and rotates the text to be horizontal.
}
