\arguments{
\item{filename}{File name to create on disk. Providing the file format
extension (e.g. .svg) is optional. The file extension must be lowercase. If
you want to save multiple files with different formats, see the
\code{format} argument for details.}

\item{...}{Plot objects to put on the panel.}

\item{plotlist}{List of plots to combine as an mpanel and save. You can also
enter the charts individually as arguments to the function.}

\item{chart_type}{Type of chart. This is used to set sensible chart widths
based on the width of text in each document. Options include 'MN' (
for micronote charts), 'RN' (research notes), 'PPT' (powerpoints).
research note),'PPT}

\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{subtitle}{The text for the subtitle.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

\item{width}{Plot width in cm. Defaults to NULL which means the width will
be set based on the chart type. Use if you want to increase the width of
the chart.}

\item{height}{Plot height in cm. If you do not specify a height, the function
will calculate an appropriate height based on the information you have provided.}

\item{max_height}{The maximum height of your plot. This is used to constrain
the plot resizing algorithm in cases where you want to limit the height of
your charts.}

\item{auto_scale}{Logical. Should the y-axis be scaled automatically. Default is TRUE.}

\item{title_adj}{Rescales the size of the title text to be slightly larger
than the titles of the subplots (default is 1.1). 2 doubles the font size.}

\item{title_spacing_adj}{Rescales the size of the space give to the mpanel
title. Use if you think the title looks too cramped on the chart.}

\item{subtitle_spacing_adj}{Rescales the size of the space give to the mpanel
subtitle. Use if you think the subtitle looks too cramped on the chart.}

\item{ncol}{(optional) Number of columns in the plot grid.}

\item{nrow}{(optional) Number of rows in the plot grid.}

\item{align}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally ("h") or
vertically ("v") aligned. Options are "none" (default), "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v".}

\item{axis}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs should be aligned by the left ("l"), right ("r"), top ("t"), or bottom ("b")
margins. Options are "none" (default), or a string of any combination of l, r, t, and b in any order (e.g. "tblr" or "rlbt" for aligning all margins).
Must be specified if any of the graphs are complex (e.g. faceted) and alignment is specified and desired. See \code{\link[cowplot:align_plots]{align_plots()}} for details.}

\item{rel_heights}{A numeric vector giving the relative proportions of each
graph component (title, plots, footer (optional)).}

\item{format}{An optional vector of file formats to save as. For example
\code{c("svg", "pdf")} will save 2 files with the same name to the same
location to SVG and PDF formats. If the file format is specified in
\code{filename}, then this argument is ignored.}

\description{
Create multi-panel graphs in the e61 style.

  This function is designed for creating 2x2 and 2x1 panel graphs, although it
  also work for any arrangement of panels (3x2 etc.). Your mileage may
  vary.
