\arguments{
\item{filename}{File name to create on disk. Providing the file format
extension (e.g. .svg) is optional. The file extension must be lowercase. If
you want to save multiple files with different formats, see the
\code{format} argument for details.}

\item{...}{(multi-panel specific) Plot objects to put on the panel.}

\item{plot}{Plot object to save. Defaults to the last plot displayed so
usually you do not need to provide this explicitly.}

\item{chart_type}{String. Type of chart. This is used to set sensible chart
widths based on the width of text in each document. Options are 'MN' ( for
micronotes), 'RN' (research notes), 'PPT' (PowerPoints).}

\item{auto_scale}{Logical. Should the y-axis be scaled automatically. Default
is TRUE.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Plot width in cm. Defaults to NULL which means the
width will be set based on the chart type.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Plot height in cm. If you do not specify a height, the
function will calculate an appropriate height.}

\item{max_height}{Numeric. The maximum height of your plot in cm. This is
used to constrain the plot resizing algorithm in cases where you want to
limit the height of your charts.}

\item{format}{An optional vector of file formats to save as. For example
\code{c("svg", "pdf")} will save 2 files with the same name to the same
location to SVG and PDF formats. If the file format is specified in
\code{filename}, then this argument is ignored.}

\item{save_data}{Logical. Set to TRUE if you want to save a .csv with the
same name as the graph that contains the data needed to recreate the graph
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{resize}{Numeric. Only used when PNG is the file format. Resize the
graph width and height. You may also need to adjust the \code{pointsize}
and \code{res} to ensure the text is readable.}

\item{pointsize}{the default pointsize of plotted text, interpreted as
    big points (1/72 inch) at \code{res} ppi.}

\item{res}{The nominal resolution in ppi which will be recorded in the
    bitmap file, if a positive integer.  Also used for units other than
    the default.  If not specified, taken as 72 ppi to set the size of
    text and line widths.}

\item{test}{For development use only.}

\item{plotlist}{(multi-panel specific) List of plots to combine as an
multi-panel and save. You can also enter the charts individually as
arguments to the function.}

\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{subtitle}{The text for the subtitle.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

\item{title_spacing_adj}{(multi-panel specific) Rescales the size of the
space give to the multi-panel title. Use if you think the title looks too
cramped on the chart.}

\item{subtitle_spacing_adj}{(multi-panel specific) Rescales the size of the
space give to the multi-panel subtitle. Use if you think the subtitle looks
too cramped on the chart.}

\item{base_size}{(multi-panel specific) Numeric. Chart font size. Default is
8.}

\item{height_adj}{(multi-panel specific) Rescales the height of the
multi-panel. The function sets sensible defaults but this provides you with
manual control if you need it.}

\item{ncol}{(optional) Number of columns in the plot grid.}

\item{nrow}{(optional) Number of rows in the plot grid.}

\item{align}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally ("h") or
vertically ("v") aligned. Options are "none" (default), "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v".}

\item{axis}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs should be aligned by the left ("l"), right ("r"), top ("t"), or bottom ("b")
margins. Options are "none" (default), or a string of any combination of l, r, t, and b in any order (e.g. "tblr" or "rlbt" for aligning all margins).
Must be specified if any of the graphs are complex (e.g. faceted) and alignment is specified and desired. See \code{\link[cowplot:align_plots]{align_plots()}} for details.}

\item{rel_heights}{(multi-panel specific) A numeric vector giving the
relative proportions of each graph component (title, plots, footer
(optional)).}

\item{title_adj}{(multi-panel specific) Rescales the size of the title text
to be slightly larger than the titles of the subplots (default is 1.1). 2
doubles the font size.}
