\arguments{
\item{filename}{File name to create on disk. Providing the file format
extension (e.g. .svg) is optional. The file extension must be lowercase. If
you want to save multiple files with different formats, see the
\code{format} argument for details.}

\item{...}{(Mpanel specific) Plot objects to put on the panel.}

\item{plot}{Plot object to save. Defaults to the last plot displayed so
usually you do not need to provide this explicitly.}

\item{chart_type}{Type of chart. This is used to set sensible chart widths
based on the width of text in each document. Options include 'MN' (
for micronote charts), 'RN' (research notes), 'PPT' (powerpoints).
research note),'PPT}

\item{auto_scale}{Logical. Should the y-axis be scaled automatically. Default is TRUE.}

\item{width}{Plot width in cm. Defaults to NULL which means the width will
be set based on the chart type.}

\item{height}{Plot height in cm. If you do not specify a height, the function
will calculate an appropriate height based on the labels you have provided.}

\item{max_height}{The maximum height of your plot. This is used to constrain
the plot resizing algorithm in cases where you want to limit the height of
your charts.}

\item{format}{An optional vector of file formats to save as. For example
\code{c("svg", "pdf")} will save 2 files with the same name to the same
location to SVG and PDF formats. If the file format is specified in
\code{filename}, then this argument is ignored.}

\item{save_data}{Logical. Set to TRUE if you want to save a .csv with the
same name as the graph that contains the data needed to recreate the graph
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{resize}{Numeric. Only used when PNG is the file format. Resize the
graph width and height. You may also need to adjust the \code{pointsize}
and \code{res} to ensure the text is readable.}

\item{pointsize}{the default pointsize of plotted text, interpreted as
    big points (1/72 inch) at \code{res} ppi.}

\item{res}{The nominal resolution in ppi which will be recorded in the
    bitmap file, if a positive integer.  Also used for \code{units}
    other than the default, and to convert points to pixels.}

\item{test}{For development use only.}

\item{plotlist}{(Mpanel specific) List of plots to combine as an mpanel and save. You can also
enter the charts individually as arguments to the function.}

\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{subtitle}{The text for the subtitle.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

\item{title_spacing_adj}{(Mpanel specific) Rescales the size of the space give to the mpanel
title. Use if you think the title looks too cramped on the chart.}

\item{subtitle_spacing_adj}{(Mpanel specific) Rescales the size of the space give to the mpanel
subtitle. Use if you think the subtitle looks too cramped on the chart.}

\item{base_size}{(Mpanel specific) Numeric. Chart font size. Default is 8.}

\item{height_adj}{(Mpanel specific) Rescales the height of the mpanel. The function sets sensible
defaults but this provides you with manial control if you need it.}

\item{ncol}{(optional) Number of columns in the plot grid.}

\item{nrow}{(optional) Number of rows in the plot grid.}

\item{align}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally ("h") or
vertically ("v") aligned. Options are "none" (default), "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v".}

\item{axis}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs should be aligned by the left ("l"), right ("r"), top ("t"), or bottom ("b")
margins. Options are "none" (default), or a string of any combination of l, r, t, and b in any order (e.g. "tblr" or "rlbt" for aligning all margins).
Must be specified if any of the graphs are complex (e.g. faceted) and alignment is specified and desired. See \code{\link[cowplot:align_plots]{align_plots()}} for details.}

\item{rel_heights}{(Mpanel specific) A numeric vector giving the relative proportions of each
graph component (title, plots, footer (optional)).}

\description{
Designed to save ggplot graphs made with the e61 theme with
  sensible defaults that ensure the text size is appropriately proportioned
  given default sizing.

  Currently the only file formats supported are \code{.pdf} or \code{.svg}
  (preferred), and \code{.png}. PDF and SVG are modern vector graphics file
  formats which can be scaled up and down in size without blurring or
  becoming pixelated. Use the PNG file format in the rare case that vector
  graphics are not supported.

  See \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}} for details on custom function arguments.
}
\details{
Setting the correct height and width parameters is quite difficult
  due to the way that ggplot translates ggplot objects from pixels into
  physical dimensions (inches or centimetres). Font sizes are also
  transformed differently to other graph elements which adds another
  dimension of difficulty. This is why \code{save_e61} generally requires you
  to provide your own height and width arguments after some trial and error,
  and produces loud messages if you stick to the defaults, which I have tried
  to make not terrible.

  If the width/height arguments are off, then the file you output will have
  excess space on the left/right or top/bottom (if the values are too high),
  or the graph itself will be shrunk and look weird (if the values are too
  low).

  This function tries to support multi-panel graphs generated using
  \code{mpanel_e61} by doubling the default width to 17, but you will need to
  make adjustments to the dimensions to ensure the graph is sized
  appropriately.
