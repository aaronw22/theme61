\arguments{
\item{filename}{File name to create on disk. Providing the file format
extension (e.g. .svg) is suggested when saving to a single file format. The
file extension must be lowercase. If you want to save to multiple formats,
do not include the extension, see the \code{format} argument for details.}

\item{...}{(multi-panel specific) Plot objects to put on the panel.}

\item{plot}{Single-panel plot object to save. Defaults to the last plot
displayed so usually you do not need to provide this explicitly.}

\item{format}{An optional vector of file formats to save as. For example
\code{c("svg", "pdf")} will save 2 files with the same name to the same
location to SVG and PDF formats. If the file format is specified in
\code{filename}, then this argument is ignored.}

\item{chart_type}{String. Type of chart. This is used to set sensible chart
widths based on the width of text in each document. Options are 'MN' ( for
micronotes), 'RN' (research notes), 'PPT' (PowerPoints).}

\item{auto_scale}{Logical. Should the y-axis be scaled automatically. Default
is TRUE.}

\item{dim}{An optional named list specifying the plot height and width.
Defaults to NULL which means the graph dimensions will be set based on the
chart type and function-calculated value.}

\item{max_height}{Numeric. The maximum height of your plot in cm. This is
used to constrain the plot resizing algorithm in cases where you want to
limit the height of your charts.}

\item{save_data}{Logical. Set to TRUE if you want to save a .csv with the
same name as the graph that contains the data needed to recreate the graph
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{base_size}{Numeric. Chart font size. Default is 10.}

\item{bg_colour}{Sets the graph background colour. Defaults to white. Accepts
a colour name, hex code or theme61 colour object name. For graphs used in
research note boxes, set the colour to e61_boxback.}

\item{plotlist}{(multi-panel specific) List of plots to combine as an
multi-panel and save. You can also enter the charts individually as
arguments to the function.}

\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{subtitle}{The text for the subtitle.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

\item{spacing_adj}{(multi-panel specific) An optional named list specifying
the adjustment to the title and subtitle. Rescales the size of the space
give to the multi-panel title/subtitle. Use if you think the title looks
too cramped on the chart.}

\item{height_adj}{(multi-panel specific) Rescales the height of the
multi-panel. The function sets sensible defaults but this provides you with
manual control if you need it.}

\item{ncol}{(optional) Number of columns in the plot grid.}

\item{nrow}{(optional) Number of rows in the plot grid.}

\item{align}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally ("h") or
vertically ("v") aligned. Options are "none" (default), "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v".}

\item{axis}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs should be aligned by the left ("l"), right ("r"), top ("t"), or bottom ("b")
margins. Options are "none" (default), or a string of any combination of l, r, t, and b in any order (e.g. "tblr" or "rlbt" for aligning all margins).
Must be specified if any of the graphs are complex (e.g. faceted) and alignment is specified and desired. See \code{\link[cowplot:align_plots]{align_plots()}} for details.}

\item{rel_heights}{(multi-panel specific) A numeric vector giving the
relative proportions of each graph component (title, plots, footer
(optional)).}

\description{
Designed to save ggplot graphs made with the e61 theme with
  sensible defaults that ensure the text size is appropriately proportioned
  given default sizing.

  The supported file formats are SVG, PDF, EPS and PNG.

  Use PDF in all notes and SVG in PowerPoint presentations. PDF and SVG are
  better as they are modern vector graphics file formats which can be scaled
  up and down in size without blurring or becoming pixelated.

  PNG should only be used for Twitter posts for compatibility reasons.

  See \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}} for details on custom function arguments.
