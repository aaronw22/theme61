\title{Saves ggplot graphs with sensible defaults}
\usage{
save_e61(
  filename,
  plot = ggplot2::last_plot(),
  width = NULL,
  height = NULL,
  resize = NULL,
  units = "cm",
  scale = 1,
  dpi = 100,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{File name to create on disk. Remember you must provide the
file extension, e.g. \code{.svg}.}

\item{plot}{Plot object to save. Defaults to the last plot displayed so
usually you do not need to provide this explicitly.}

\item{resize}{Rescales the graph and text. Useful when you need a very large
or small graph and cannot use a vector graphics format. This only works
when saving to the PNG file format. A value of 2 doubles the graph
dimensions.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{scale}}{Multiplicative scaling factor.}
    \item{\code{width,height,units}}{Plot size in \code{units} ("in", "cm", "mm", or "px").
If not supplied, uses the size of current graphics device.}
    \item{\code{dpi}}{Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320),
"print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.}
  }}
}
\description{
Designed to save ggplot graphs made with the e61 theme with
  sensible defaults that ensure the text size is appropriately proportioned
  given default sizing.

  Currently the only file formats supported are \code{.svg} (preferred) and
  \code{.png}. SVG is a modern vector graphics file format which means it can
  be scaled up and down in size without blurring or becoming pixelated. Use
  the PNG file format in the rare case that vector graphics are not
  supported.

  See \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}} for details on custom function arguments.

\details{
Setting the correct height and width parameters is quite difficult
  due to the way that ggplot translates ggplot objects from pixels into
  physical dimensions (inches or centimetres). Font sizes are also
  transformed differently to other graph elements which adds another
  dimension of difficulty. This is why \code{save_e61} generally requires you
  to provide your own height and width arguments after some trial and error,
  and produces loud messages if you stick to the defaults, which I have tried
  to make not terrible.

  If the width/height arguments are off, then the file you output will have
  excess space on the left/right or top/bottom (if the values are too high),
  or the graph itself will be shrunk and look weird (if the values are too
  low).
