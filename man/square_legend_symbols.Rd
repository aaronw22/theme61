\title{Converts all legend colours to squares}
\usage{
square_legend_symbols(size = 6)

works well when \code{ymin} or \code{ymax} are not present.}
}
\value{
ggplot object

\description{
Legend symbols for line graphs default to coloured lines, which can sometimes
be hard to read. This function overrides the default and converts the colours
to squares. This needs to be used in conjunction with some invisible point
geoms so the function has a shape to reshape.
}
\examples{
ggplot2::ggplot(data.frame(x = c(1, 2), y = c(5, 6), group = c("A", "A")),
  aes(x, y, colour = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0) + # The required "invisible points"
  square_legend_symbols()
