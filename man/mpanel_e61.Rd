\arguments{
\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggpubr:ggarrange]{ggpubr::ggarrange}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{plotlist}}{(optional) list of plots to display.}
    \item{\code{ncol}}{(optional) number of columns in the plot grid.}
    \item{\code{nrow}}{(optional) number of rows in the plot grid.}
    \item{\code{labels}}{(optional) list of labels to be added to the plots. You can
also set labels="AUTO" to auto-generate upper-case labels or labels="auto"
to auto-generate lower-case labels.}
    \item{\code{label.x}}{(optional) Single value or vector of x positions for plot
labels, relative to each subplot. Defaults to 0 for all labels. (Each label
is placed all the way to the left of each plot.)}
    \item{\code{label.y}}{(optional) Single value or vector of y positions for plot
labels, relative to each subplot. Defaults to 1 for all labels. (Each label
is placed all the way to the top of each plot.)}
    \item{\code{hjust}}{Adjusts the horizontal position of each label. More negative values move the label further
to the right on the plot canvas. Can be a single value (applied to all labels) or a vector of values
(one for each label). Default is -0.5.}
    \item{\code{vjust}}{Adjusts the vertical position of each label. More positive values move the label further
down on the plot canvas. Can be a single value (applied to all labels) or a vector of values
(one for each label). Default is 1.5.}
    \item{\code{font.label}}{a list of arguments for customizing labels. Allowed values
are the combination of the following elements: size (e.g.: 14), face (e.g.:
"plain", "bold", "italic", "bold.italic"), color (e.g.: "red") and family.
For example font.label = list(size = 14, face = "bold", color ="red").}
    \item{\code{align}}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally ("h") or
vertically ("v") aligned. Options are "none" (default), "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v".}
    \item{\code{widths}}{(optional) numerical vector of relative columns widths. For
example, in a two-column grid, widths = c(2, 1) would make the first column
twice as wide as the second column.}
    \item{\code{heights}}{same as \code{widths} but for column heights.}
    \item{\code{legend}}{character specifying legend position. Allowed values are one of
c("top", "bottom", "left", "right", "none"). To remove the legend use
legend = "none".}
    \item{\code{common.legend}}{logical value. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, a common
unique legend will be created for arranged plots.}
    \item{\code{legend.grob}}{a legend grob as returned by the function
\code{\link[ggpubr]{get_legend}()}. If provided, it will be used as the common
legend.}
  }}

\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

ggplot2 object

\description{
Wrapper around \link[ggpubr]{ggarrange} and \code{labs_e61} to
  create multi-panel graphs with appropriate title and footer formatting.

  This function is designed for creating 2x2 panel graphs, although it should
  work for any arrangement of panels (e.g. 2x1, 3x2, etc.). Your mileage may
  vary.

  Subtitles are currently not supported in the multi-panel header.

  When saving multi-panel graphs using \code{save_e61()} you will need to
  change (increase) the width and height arguments to reflect the larger size
  of multi-panel graphs.
