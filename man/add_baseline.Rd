\title{Adds a thin black line}
\usage{
add_baseline(y = 0, colour = "black", linewidth = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric. The y-intercept of the line. Defaults to 0. You can set it
to 100 if you have an index on your y-axis, for example. Or any other value
if you're feeling chaotic.}

\item{colour}{String. The line is black by default but you can change it if
you need another colour.}

\item{linewidth}{Numeric. Set the thickness of the line. Default (0.25)
should be appropriate for default graph scaling.}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
Adds a thin black line (by default at y = 0). This is useful shorthand for
when you would otherwise have to use \code{geom_hline}, which by default adds
a black line that is too thick.
}
\details{
Some examples of when you want a baseline include whenever the y-axis on your
graph includes 0 (for units and percentages) or 100 (for indices that start
at 100).
